# ShareMood
With COVID-19 increasing the distance between people and work from home becoming the new norm, growing concerns for mental health have become apparent. According to a survey by TELUS International, 45% of employees felt less healthy mentally while working from home during the pandemic citing feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. How can employers check-in before their employees check out? 

ShareMood is an interactive platform for employees to check-in by anonymously sharing their current mood. Each submission will be posted to a company-wide board where employees can connect and empathize with each other through comments. With unhappy employees reporting to cost the North American economy over $350 billion per year, anonymity will allow employees to express themselves freely and provide valuable insights for managers to act immediately.
